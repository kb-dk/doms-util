This contains a log4j appender that will cache messages in a registry, for
later access through the surveyable framework.

To use this log4j appender, simply configure your log4j to use it in log4j.xml.
This will cause the appender to start caching the messages in a registry.

To expose that registry, use the Surveyable implementation from domsutil.
Configure it to expose the "LogRegistrySurveyableSingleton".

Examples of configuration can be found in log4j-example.xml and web-example.xml.
